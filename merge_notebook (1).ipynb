It is the same for the 2015 2016 and 2017 for the negative posts that don't appear, even if when we are calling the numbers they do exists. Their value is too small compared to the value of negative posts in 2014 to be seen on a graph, even when plotted alone. The small amount of posts in 2013 could be explained by the gain of popularity of the website, or the change in behavior of the population (who is more and more connected via internet and social network, and have better access to technology). The big amount of negative votes might comes from an external events. \n",

Time is the major parameter we didn’t take into account during structure network analysis, so here we’ll try to see if in fact it may have an impact on it. It is our first variable.

It can give cues on the local redundancy of the given node: if we remove this node, may it have an impact on the capacity of its neighbor to communicate and influence each other? Big clustering coefficient : the impact will be small because neighbor nodes will still be able to communicate while small coefficients reveal possible bad consequences for neighbor communication in case of removal.\n",

The local clustering coefficient gives information about the degree of how nodes cluster together with the neighbor nodes. To see the effect of nodes on other nodes the centrality is calculated.

        "Let’s have a look on the wikipedia dataset. As a reminder, we splitted the data according to 3 ratio neg/pos edges different. The first part is from november and represent the group with low ratio (not a lot of neg edges), the second part is from june and represent the group with middle ratio (quite the same amount of  pos and neg edges) and finally the third one is from july and represent the group with a high ratio (quite a lot  of negative edges). \n",

        "The average degree value is quite the same for all the 3 months \n",
        "The closeness average value is also quite constant among the 3 months \n",
        "The local clustering coefficient is rising according to the proportion of negative edges. This means that it is small in november, higher in june and even higher in july (which has the biggest ratio). Even if it is hard to do a guess about why do we see a such trend, the arrival of the summer and holidays may have a link with people's activity and thus their amount of connections to each other. In fact a higher local clustering coefficient means that the removal of a given node will have less impact on the ability of communication of influence of its neighbor. It is quite important to notice that during votation process because it means on the other side that during winter (e.g. november), node’s communication/influence are more dependant to each other and thus individual position-taking can have a big consequences, and its nature -an opposite leader or a supporter- may become important.\n",

        "It is quite hard to explain all the trends, sometimes quite small or illogical. However these observations and understanding could be important in a votation process because as we have seen that may have an impact on the global structure of the network. With the local clustering coefficient, we have seen that the network tends to be more influenceable in winter than in summer, thus political calculations may take it into account. Also it appears that the summer network tends to be more connected, so with more closed triangles than in winter. Thus people are more connected and as they are influencing each other, the strategy of communication of a candidate may change (could focus on a group of people, because they tend to be more connected than patchy ones in the winter where it would be more difficult to talk to a group). Finally, even if the trend is not very logical, assortativity may give important information on the network structure. November and July seem to be more diss-assortative, thus it means that links between nodes are not very similar. So for a candidate talking to a group, it is important to have conscious of this, an adapt its speech : it would be perhaps more nuanced than if all people were similar, because its aim is to gather as many people as possible, so not to offend/ hurt or shock any part of the listening assembly.\n"

        "Now we are going to focus on the influence of the weekday on the voting behavior. As a reminder, we have created 2 subgraphs according to the trend observed along the week. We have seen that the ratio neg/pos is becoming more important along the workweek, and that during the week-end, saturday looks like monday and sunday looks like friday. With very basic psychology, one interpretation would be that along the week people are getting more and more tired and are generally fed up. On saturday it is the beginning of the weekend, so people are more happy and then tend to vote less negatively, while on sunday it is the end of the weekend, so people are sad and annoyed by the situation. This try of explanation is based on the idea that people’s mood influences the vote. To be more precise in the analysis of trend’s observations we would need to go further in social analysis/explanation, but we are not competent here. Anyway, this trial of explanation can give an idea. \n",

As we were able to see on the graph of the ratio, lower one corresponds to the mid-day period, while higher one corresponds to the afternoon/night and morning period. One could understand it during the lunch break, people tend to be more happy and thus vote less negatively. Of course it is only an hypothesis, but it can give an idea. \n",
